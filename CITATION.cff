  While there exist many ways to deploy machine
  learning models on microcontrollers, it is
  non-trivial to choose the optimal combination of
  frameworks and targets for a given application.
  Thus, automating the end-to-end benchmarking flow
  is of high relevance nowadays. A tool called
  MLonMCU is proposed in this paper and demonstrated
  by benchmarking the state-of-the-art TinyML
  frameworks TFLite for Microcontrollers and TVM
  effortlessly with large number of configurations in
  a low amount of time.
